        <p>
          I am Aaryan Kumar Jaiswal, a 3rd-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering at KPGU, Vadodara. I’m passionate about programming, web development, and UI/UX design. I’m currently leading a government-funded SSIP startup project and have also participated in national-level hackathons. I’m eager to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, learn from professionals, and grow as a full-stack developer.
